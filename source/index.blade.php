    <p>Artisan Static is a starter template for building a static Jigsaw blog hosted on Netlify.</p>

    <p>This comes with code highlighting, share buttons, comments, analytics, an RSS feed, a contact form, a CMS and more.</p>

    <p>The HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this template are extremely minimal, which makes the code easy to build on top of or replace completely.</p>
